## description
 I made this project to help a business handel their employee database
 This solves the issue of trying to keep track of employees, what their roles are, how much they are paid, and who their managers are. 
 In doing this project I gained a better understanding of mysql and how to use it. I learned more about how to merge tables in mysql. I learned how to use inquere to bring back the tables that I want. 

## Installation
  To install this program you will need to bring over the files and do an npm install. Once that is done, enter node index.js in the command line and it will start the program, which will guide you from there.

## usage
  Once you have started up the program you will see the options of what you can do in the database. To get to each option use the up and down arrow keys. Not everything is shown on the menu so keep scrolling to see every option. Press enter to selection that option. If you choose to see a table it will generate that table. If you chose to update or delete something it will ask you a couple questions and once you have answered them it will then show you the updated table. Below is a video walkthrough of the program.
